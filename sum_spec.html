          Ondra bolted Silence way back in 2012-2013 while he was climbing
          Change, but cast it aside for the time stating, “I could sort of
          imagine doing the individual moves, but I could see that linking the
          whole sequence, with its 8C boulder, all the way from the ground just
          looked way too ridiculous”. He began seriously dedicating himself to
          the ambitious project in 2015.
        </p>
        <!-- text for section -->
        <p>
          Successfully climbing Silence required colossal effort from Ondra.
          This speaks to the route’s difficulty as Adam is known for quickly
          putting down the world’s hardest climbs. It took Ondra 40 days of
          effort spread out over seven trips to Flatanger to successfully climb
          it. During this 2015-2017 time period, Ondra partook in hyperspecific
          training and visualization exercises to increase his chances of
          sending. He even built a gym in Flatanger in order to train and warm
          up while in the area.
        </p>
        <!-- text for section -->

          Ondra finally sent Silence on September 3rd, 2017. Reflecting on the
          climb he stated, “At the end of the route when I knew I did it, I had
          one of the strangest emotions ever. I clipped the anchor and I could
          not even scream. All I could do was just hang in the rope, feeling
          tears in my eyes. It was too much joy, relief, and excitement all
          mixed together.” Because of this feeling combined with the inner
          silence and tranquility he claims to have felt while climbing it, he
          gave the route its name – Silence.

          Unroped and alone, Marc-André Leclerc moves cautiously up the grey
          diorite of Mt. Slesse’s East Buttress Direct, a 2,500-foot 5.10+. He
          pauses at the friable crux and then pushes through, gunning for a
          link-up of three routes to the 8,002-foot summit in a single day. It’s
          late August 2014. This massive stone mountain is in Leclerc’s backyard
          of the Cascade Mountains of British Columbia, where he first climbed
          as a child.
        </p>
        <!-- text for section -->

        <p>
          After climbing for two hours, Leclerc tops out. He picks his way to
          the summit proper, where he stops briefly before descending via the
          Southwest Buttress. And then it’s on to the next 2,500 feet of
          climbing. All told, Leclerc wraps up the three routes—East Buttress
          Direct, Navigator Wall (5.10+), and Northeast Buttress (5.9+),
          comprising 7,000 feet of climbing—in just over 12 hours. It is a
          monumental accomplishment, one among many over the past few years for
          the 24-year-old. As he will blog, during one descent he repeats the
          mantra I feel like a cat, I feel like a ninja! I feel like a ninja
          cat! An ALPINE ninja cat! much to his own amusement.
        </p>
        <!-- text for section -->
        <p>
          Today, Leclerc is based in the Fraser River Valley with his
          girlfriend, Brette Harrington. (Harrington is herself an accomplished
          soloist and alpinist, known for her 2015 free solo of Chiaro di Luna,
          a 2,500-foot 5.11a on Aguja Saint-Exupery in the Fitzroy Massif.) You
          may recognize Leclerc for his February 2015 solo of Cerro Torre’s The
          Corkscrew linkup (5.10d A1 90 degrees; 3,900 feet), a circumnavigation
          of the Patagonian spire. Patagonia veteran Rolando Garibotti, who
          wrote the guidebook PataClimb.com, noted at his site that Leclerc’s
          ascent was one of “earth-shifting proportions, by far the hardest
          route ever soloed on Cerro Torre and only the seventh solo overall.”
        </p>
        <!-- text for section -->
        <p>
          On the route, Leclerc climbed almost entirely ropeless, self-belaying
          in only two spots by back-looping his cord. Or perhaps you know about
          Leclerc and Colin Haley’s first ascent in January 2015 of La Travesía
          del Oso Buda (5.10a A1 M6; 3,900 feet; aka the Reverse Torre
          Traverse), a skyline linkup of the Cerro Torre Group. Or perhaps you
          heard about his summer 2016 first ascent with Harrington and Joshua
          Lavigne of the West Buttress (VI 5.12a C1) of Great Sail Peak on
          Baffin Island. Or you may know him from his backyard granite area
          Squamish, where he’s speed-soloed the Grand Wall (III 5.11 A0) as part
          of a 17-hour “house-to-house” marathon day that involved free soloing,
          rope soloing, and aiding 32 pitches on the Stawamus Chief; and
          repeated Bruce Lee Vs. the Kiss Army (5.13 R/X), Andrew Boyd’s
          hairball 2004 headpoint.

          Weekly Challenges And Goals
        </h1>
        <!-- text for section -->
        <p>
          Today we’re exploring how to hit our 2024 New Year’s goals by
          exploring how our values affect our motivation. When you climb and
          train, the success of your session usually comes down to how motivated
          you’re feeling on any given day. On some days, you wake up feeling
          super psyched and will have a great session regardless of the
          conditions and the outcome. And on some days… you really don’t. This
          blog will explore some strategies to help you feel motivated, and
          satisfied with your training, when it comes to working towards your
          climbing goals.
        </p>
        <!-- text for section -->
        <p>
          Identifying your climbing values can be an important step in feeling
          like you’re making progress with your training, as this should shape
          and inform your 2024 goal setting, making the goals you set relevant,
          meaningful and specific. As with all aspects of training, taking the
          time to reflect on your values (and using this to inform your
          training) might not appeal to everyone. It might not feel as rewarding
          as completing that extra core session at the climbing gym. However,
          take some time to consider the phrases below. If this is something
          that you can relate to, then reflecting on your values could be of
          great benefit to your performance and your enjoyment of
          climbing/training because of the positive impact that it could have on
          your motivation.
        </p>
        <!-- text for section -->
        <p>
          You have a lack of consistency with your training. You tend to
          overthink your climbing, training and progress You are consistently
          unsatisfied with your progress. You lack direction with your goal
          setting. Do these sentiments ring true? If so, why? For a better
          understanding let’s take a very quick look at the Self-Determination
          Theory of Motivation, based on work by researchers Edward Deci and
          Richard Ryan in the 70s and 80s. The Self-Determination Theory argues
          that motivation is determined by three psychological factors. These
          are: Autonomy – Defined as feeling like you have a choice/control over
          your own behaviours and actions and that the choices you make are
          self-driven. Competence – Defined as self-perceived mastery and a
          feeling that you are capable in a given activity/context. Relatedness
          – Defined as the desire to feel connected with others and to have a
          sense of belonging.
